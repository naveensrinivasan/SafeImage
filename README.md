# SafeImage

## CAUTION THERE ARE SOME NUDE PICTURES IN THIS REPO FOR TESTING

The goal of this repo is to use [google vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) and [AWS rekognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/) to identify inappropriate images. Compare which of these services is able to identify these inappropriate	 images.

This is for testing these services. I have also used the googles **detect text** api to identify swear words  using OCR and loading curse words from a folder.
